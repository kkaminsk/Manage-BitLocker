# Manage-BitLocker Application Specification

## Application Overview
- **Name**: Manage-BitLocker
- **Language**: PowerShell
- **Purpose**: To provide a graphical interface for managing BitLocker encryption status on Windows systems.

## Technical Requirements
1. **Administrative Privileges**: 
   - The application must run with administrator privileges.
   - Implement a check to ensure the script is run as an administrator, exiting if not.

2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
   - Create a window using PowerShell's Windows Forms.
   - Display the current BitLocker status.
   - Show the time of the last status check.
   - Include buttons for enabling and disabling BitLocker encryption.
   - Provide a button to manually query and update the BitLocker status.

3. **BitLocker Management**:
   - Implement functions to:
     - Check the current status of BitLocker encryption.
     - Enable BitLocker encryption.
     - Disable BitLocker encryption.
   - Use appropriate PowerShell cmdlets for BitLocker operations (e.g., Get-BitLockerVolume, Enable-BitLocker, Disable-BitLocker).

4. **Logging**:
   - Create a log file in the same directory as the script.
   - Log all actions with timestamps, including:
     - Application start and exit.
     - BitLocker status checks.
     - Attempts to enable or disable BitLocker.
     - Any errors or exceptions encountered.

## User Interface Design
1. **Main Window**:
   - Title: "Manage-BitLocker"
   - Size: Appropriate to fit all elements (e.g., 400x300 pixels)
   - Elements:
     - Status Label: Displays "BitLocker Status: [Enabled/Disabled]"
     - Last Checked Label: Shows "Last Checked: [Timestamp]"
     - Enable Button: Labeled "Enable BitLocker"
     - Disable Button: Labeled "Disable BitLocker"
     - Refresh Button: Labeled "Refresh Status"
     - Exit Button: Labeled "Exit"

## Functional Specifications

1. **Application Initialization**:
   - Check for administrative privileges.
   - Initialize the GUI.
   - Perform an initial BitLocker status check.
   - Update the GUI with the current status and timestamp.

2. **Enable BitLocker Function**:
   - Triggered by the "Enable BitLocker" button.
   - Attempt to enable BitLocker on the system drive.
   - Log the action and result.
   - Update the GUI to reflect the new status.
   - Display a message box with the result of the operation.

3. **Disable BitLocker Function**:
   - Triggered by the "Disable BitLocker" button.
   - Attempt to disable BitLocker on the system drive.
   - Log the action and result.
   - Update the GUI to reflect the new status.
   - Display a message box with the result of the operation.

4. **Refresh Status Function**:
   - Triggered by the "Refresh Status" button.
   - Query the current BitLocker status.
   - Update the GUI with the new status and current timestamp.
   - Log the action.

5. **Logging Function**:
   - Create a new log file if it doesn't exist.
   - Append new log entries to the existing file.
   - Format: "[Timestamp] - [Action/Event]"

6. **Exit Function**:
   - Triggered by the "Exit" button or closing the window.
   - Log the application exit.
   - Close the GUI and terminate the script.

## Error Handling
- Implement try-catch blocks for all BitLocker operations.
- Display user-friendly error messages via message boxes.
- Log all errors with detailed information for troubleshooting.

## Security Considerations
- Ensure the script is digitally signed if it will be distributed.
- Implement checks to prevent multiple instances of the application from running simultaneously.

## Testing Requirements
- Test the application on various Windows versions (e.g., Windows 10, Windows 11).
- Verify all functions work correctly with BitLocker in different initial states.
- Ensure proper error handling for scenarios like lack of TPM, unsupported drive configurations, etc.

## Deployment
- Package the script with any necessary dependencies.
- Provide clear instructions for running the script with administrative privileges.

## Maintenance and Support
- Plan for periodic updates to ensure compatibility with future Windows updates.
- Establish a process for users to report issues and request features.

This specification outlines the requirements and functionality for the Manage-BitLocker application. It serves as a guide for development, testing, and future maintenance of the application.
